							<h1> Lab 14 - Debugging Tools and Strategies  </h1>

							<h2> Prompt </h2>

									<p> This lab is to demonstrate how to create a loop by using a function that prints through 1-200 and create a fizz, buzz, or boom whenever the number is a multiple of 3, 5, or 7.</p>

							<h2> Difficulties </h2>

									<p>  Our challenge for this lab was trying to make the output of our program appear in our output div. We tried troubleshooting with different codes and rewatching the lecture but still could not figure out what the problem was. We believe that the main problem was with the html and now the javascript. We made sure that the Javascript was not the main issue because we ran it through replit and it ran perfectly fine. We believe that the main confusion for us was number 8 in the javascript task where it asks about compiling one long string as our output numbers.  </p>
