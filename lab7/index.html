					<h1> Lab 7 - Functions </h1>

					<h2> Summary </h2>
								<p> This lab is to demostate our new knowledge of functions and how they work in javascript.</p>

					<h2> Difficulties </h2>
								<p> The main difficulty we had was making the popup prompt show up. We made sure there was every part of the code was there but it was still not working. We looked back on the video lecture and we also went to W3 schools to see what part of the code was causing the problem. Instead of having the pop up show when the page loads we included a button for the user to click on. Now when the user clicks on the button the pop up does show up. We weren't sure if the names is actually supposed to show up on the website like Wes demonstrated or if we just had to create a pop up but we never figured out how to actually display the username on the website.  </p>
