							<h1> Lab 11 - Libraries and jQuery </h1>

							<h2> Prompt </h2>

									<p id= first> For this lab, the goal was to experiment with jQuery and how to create buttons with corresponding labels and class specials. </p>
								<button id="first-butt">
									Click Me!
								</button>

							<h2> Difficulties </h2>

									<p id=second> At first, it was a little confusing for us to create a class special to change the colors for each division but we rewatched the lecture and figured it out. </p>
									<button id="second-butt">
										What does this do?
									</button>

							<h2> Results </h2>

									<p id=third> As a result, we were able to make each button change the text. Underneath this text should be images of our html and javascript. </p>
									<button id="third-butt">
										I dare you to do it!
									</button>

 							<h2> Pictures </h2>
